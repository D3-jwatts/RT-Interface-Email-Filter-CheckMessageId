INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

CONFIGURE

Add 'Filter::CheckMessageId' to the list of mail plugins in RT_SiteConfig.pm.

Restart web server.

If you are running RT-3.8 you will need to use slightly different syntax

Set(@MailPlugins, qw(CheckMessageId));

You will also need to add RT::Extension::TicketFromMessageId to your
Plugins list.

Set(@Plugins,(qw(RT::Extension::TicketFromMessageId)))

Enjoy.
